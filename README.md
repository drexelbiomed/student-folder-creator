# Student Folder Creator

Automates the process of creating unique folders for all students in academic program. Previously, I created manually created folders for all students labeled with their name and University ID number. When students number in the hundreds, this tool saves several hours of copying and pasting.

Made with the Ruby programming language.

## Usage

Use the Ruby version manager [rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv#installation) to install Ruby.

Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:drexelbiomed/student-folder-creator.git`

Once in the project directory, run the program by entering `ruby folder_creator.rb` in the terminal. To see the created folders, see the `output` folder.
